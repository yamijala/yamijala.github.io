<p>I am Sharma SRKC Yamijala, a computational chemistry post doctoral scholar working in the group of <a href="http://www.bmwong-group.com/">Prof. Bryan Wong</a> at the University of California, Riverside. On this website you will find some of my research updates. </p>

<p>
Earlier, I have worked in the group of <a href="http://sas.rochester.edu/chm/groups/huo/">Prof. Pengfei (Frank) Huo</a> at the University of Rochester, as a postdoc and in <a href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/pati/">Prof. Swapan K. Pati</a>'s group as a Ph.D. student.

<p>
My current interests lie in the theory and implementation of various nonadiabatic dynamics techniques.
