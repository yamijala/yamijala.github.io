<p>I am Sharma SRKC Yamijala, a computational chemistry post doctoral scholar working with the group of <a href="http://www.bmwong-group.com/">Prof. Bryan Wong</a> at the University of California, Riverside. On this website you will find some of my research updates. </p>

<p>
Earlier, I have worked with <a href="http://sas.rochester.edu/chm/groups/huo/">Prof. Pengfei (Frank) Huo's</a> group at the University of Rochester, as a postdoc and with <a href="http://www.jncasr.ac.in/pati/">Prof. Swapan K. Pati's</a> group as a Ph.D. student.
</p>

<p>
My current interests lie in the theory and implementation of various nonadiabatic dynamics techniques.
